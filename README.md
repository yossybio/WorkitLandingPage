## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project has been a great experience and an excellent opportunity to practice what I learned in the HTML & CSS course on Udemy.
It was a great exercise in working with Flexbox and CSS Grid, reinforcing my understanding of modern layout techniques.

Additionally, I explored and learned how to work with the Layers feature in Lunacy, which helped improve my design workflow.

### Continued development

I will continue developing and practicing what Iâ€™ve learned. Additionally, I plan to improve the Tic-Tac-Toe game I previously built and work on a more comprehensive project utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.

### Useful resources
